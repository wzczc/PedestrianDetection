follow the github tutorial to configure the environment

train:
    python train.py config/config.py [--iter x (which epoch to start with)]
    * can change parameters at config/config.py such as epochs,batchsize,iter_per_epoch(imgs_per_epoch)
    * having trained with configs provided in the code ,training results are stored at output/ckpt 

test:
    * before test should create a .txt including the names of images wanting to test
    * wtxt.py can help create test.txt that includes all test images' names
    python test.py --testiter x  (choose epoch weights to test-->from epoch x to epoch ? defined in test.py)
    * having tested with epoch 25 to 108, best result 5.59%MR at epoch 83

debug:
    * can show results in images,should first write images'names to test.txt 
    python test.py --testiter x --debug  (choose epoch weights to debug-->from epoch x to epoch ? defined in test.py, 
                                          weights should be stored in output/ckpt)
